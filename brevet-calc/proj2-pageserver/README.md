# Basic commands

* Command to get information about docker setup on your machine

  ```
  docker info
  ```

* List of docker containers running can be found using

  ```
  docker ps -a
  ```

* Remove containers using

  ```
  sudo docker rm <Container Name>
  ```

* To run docker container use

  ```
  docker run -h CONTAINER1 -i -t debian /bin/bash
  docker run -h CONTAINER1 -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
  ```

  Here, -h is used to specify a container name, -t to start with tty, and -i means interactive. Note: second times will be quick because of caching.

* Docker with networking

  ```
  docker run -h CONTAINER2 -i -t --net="bridge" debian /bin/bash
  ```

* When the containers are not running and when you're done, kill them using

  ```
  docker rm `docker ps --no-trunc -aq`
  ```

* Rename using

  ```
  docker rename name_v0 name_v1
  ```

* Start a container using

  ```
  docker start <container name>
  ```

* Stop a container using

  ```
  docker start <container name>
  ```

# Creating images

* Create a Dockerfile. The name is case sensitive and it has to be "Dockerfile"

  ```
  vim Dockerfile
  ```

* FROM command specifies the base image you are going to use build your dockerfile and your new image. It's can an existing image, like ubuntu, alpine, debian, etc.

  ```
   FROM debian
  ```

* CMD command specifies all the commands you need to run

  ```
   CMD echo hello world
  ```

* Build the image with folder name ("." in this case)

  ```
   docker build .
  ```

* Output

  ```
  Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
  ```
  
  ```
  Step 1/2 : FROM alpine  
  ```
  
  ```
  latest: Pulling from library/alpine  
  ```
  
  ```
  ff3a5c916c92: Pull complete  
  ```
  
  ```
  Digest: sha256:7df6db5aa61ae9480f52f0b3a06a140ab98d427f86d8d5de0bedab9b8df6b1c0  
  ```
  
  ```
  Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest  
  ```
  
  ```
  ---> 3fd9065eaf02  
  ```
  
  ```
  Step 2/2 : CMD ["echo hello world"]  
  ```
  
  ```
  ---> Running in 48cd3d25065d  
  ```
  
  ```
  Removing intermediate container 48cd3d25065d  
  ```
  
  ```
  ---> e2e741ea5f6f  
  ```
  
  ```
  Successfully built e2e741ea5f6f  
  ```

* Run the image using the image ID ("e2e741ea5f6f" in this case) and a test name of your choice

  ```
  docker run --name <test name> e2e741ea5f6f
  ```

* List images using

  ```
  sudo docker images
  ```

* Remove images using

  ```
  docker rmi <Image ID>
  ```

# Getting started on the flask project

* Go to the web folder in the repository. Read every line of the docker file and the simple flask app.

* Build the simple flask app image using

  ```
  docker build -t UOCIS-flask-demo .
  ```
  
* Run the container using
  
  ```
  docker run -d -p 5000:5000 UOCIS-flask-demo
  ```

* Launch http://127.0.0.1:5000 using web broweser and check the output "UOCIS docker demo!"

# Tasks

* The goal of this project is to implement the same "file checking" logic that you implemented in project 1 using flask. 

* Like project 1, if a file ("name.html") exists, transmit "200/OK" header followed by that file html. If the file doesn't exist, transmit an error code in the header along with the appropriate page html in the body. You'll do this by creating error handlers taught in class (refer to the slides; it's got all the tricks needed). You'll also create the following two html files with the error messages. 
    * "404.html" will display "File not found!"
    * "403.html" will display "File is forbidden!"
    
* Update your name and email in the Dockerfile.

* You will submit your credentials.ini in canvas. It should have information on how we should get your Dockerfile and your git repo. 

# Grading Rubric
* If your code works as expected: 100 points.

* For every wrong functionality (i.e., (a), (b), and (c) from project 1), 20 points will be docked off. 

* If none of the functionalities work, 40 points will be given assuming 
    * the credentials.ini is submitted with the correct URL of your repo, 
    * the Dockerfile builds without any errors, and 
    * if the two html files (404.html and 403.html) are created in the appropriate location. 
    
* If the Dockerfile doesn't build or is missing, 20 points will be docked off.

* If the two html files are missing, 20 points will be docked off.

* If credentials.ini is missing, 0 will be assigned.
